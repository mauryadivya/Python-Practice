This is collection of python questions I have tried my hands on.
There is question written with numbers and solution right below the question.
Done a project on Calculator, used if else functions of python to write the code for Calculator. I have sound understanding of Python. Datatypes I used are list, string, numpy, set, tuples. Used functions like lambda, apply, map, if else, while loop.
